- Dropzone file uploader replaced with Blueimp's jQuery-File-Upload, which provides out of the box following features:

- Improved Filetree: allow to open and display multiple subfolders at a time
- Improved manipulation of Filetree nodes:
    * rewritten most of items manipulation methods to perform all possible operations on client-side;
    * this made possible to significantly reduce number of server requests (which is critical for S3 servers that charge you for each request);
    * implemented "moveNode" for Drag & Drop and "replace" action;
- Implemented "moveNode" for Drag & Drop and "replace" action
- Added new "Type" column in the list view
- Implemented natural sorting on the client-side for Filetree nodes and Fileinfo items after "upload", "add", "rename", "move" and other actions

- Caching result of some requests which were duplicated for Filetree and Fileinfo sections (like "getfolder")
- Reduced number of requests to server by implementing "getFolderData" method that caches data for a short time
- Rewritten most of items manipulation methods to perform all possible operations on client-side, that makes possible
to significantly reduce number of server requests (which is critical for S3 servers that charge you for each request)
