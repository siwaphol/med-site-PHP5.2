The sensitivity of the method was evaluated and tested with 751 fecal specimens collected from Japanese children with acute diarrhea. Several kinds of viruses were detected in 528 out of 751 (70.3%) fecal specimens. Mixed-infection with different viruses in clinical specimens could also be effectively detected.

The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of PV strains by detecting the virus in pediatric patients who admitted to the hospitals with diarrhea in Chiang Mai, Thailand during 2010-2015. By applying a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing analysis of 1,300 stool specimens collected from pediatric patients, PVs were detected at 0.61% (8 out of 1,300 specimens). Among eight PV positive samples, mixed infection with norovirus or human bocavirus was detected in one each out of eight cases. All PV strains detected in this study were characterized further by phylogenetic analysis of 343 bp of the 5'' UTR and 315 bp of the partial VP1 sequences.

The development of immunological diagnosis for norovirus had been hindered by the antigen specificity of the polyclonal antibody. Therefore, several laboratories have produced broadly reactive monoclonal antibodies, which recognize the linear GI and GII cross-reactive epitopes or the conformational GI-specific epitope. In this study, we characterized the novel monoclonal antibody 14-1 (MAb14-1) for further development of the rapid immunochromatography test. Our results demonstrated that MAb14-1 could recognize 15 recombinant virus-like particles (GI/1, 4, 8, and 11 and GII/1 to 7 and 12 to 15) and showed weak affinity to the virus-like particle of GI/3. This recognition range is the broadest of the existing monoclonal antibodies. The epitope for MAb14-1 was identified by fragment, sequence, structural, and mutational analyses. Both terminal antigenic regions (amino acid positions 418 to 426 and 526 to 534) on the C-terminal P1 domain formed the conformational epitope and were in the proximity of the insertion region (positions 427 to 525). These regions contained six amino acids responsible for antigenicity that were conserved among genogroup(s), genus, and Caliciviridae.

By employing a yeast two-hybrid assay, we found that domain III of DENV E interacts with human immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP). The relevance of this interaction was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization of BiP and DENV E in dengue virus-infected cells. Using the same approach, association of DENV E with two other chaperones, calnexin and calreticulin was also observed. Knocking-down expression of BiP, calnexin, or calreticulin by siRNA significantly decreased the production of infectious dengue virions. These results indicate that the interaction of these three chaperones with DENV E plays an important role in virion production, likely facilitating proper folding and assembly of dengue proteins.', '19105951', '2009', NULL, '196-200', '2016-10-19 22:06:16', '2016-10-19 22:06:16'),

In this study, viruses harboring the alanine-scanning and other multiple-point mutations of the pr-M junction were generated, employing a dengue virus background that exhibited 60 to 70% prM cleavage and a preponderance of virion-sized extracellular particles. Analysis of prM and its cleavage products in viable mutants revealed a cleavage-suppressive effect at the conserved P3 Glu residue, as well as the cleavage-augmenting effects at the P5 Arg and P6 His residues, indicating an interplay between opposing modulatory influences mediated by these residues on the cleavage of the pr-M junction. Changes in the prM cleavage level were associated with altered proportions of extracellular virions and subviral particles; mutants with reduced cleavage were enriched with subviral particles and prM-containing virions, whereas the mutant with enhanced cleavage was deprived of these particles. Alterations of virus multiplication were detected in mutants with reduced prM cleavage and were correlated with their low specific infectivities.

Unexpectedly, JEVpr/16681 exhibited decreased focus size, reduced peak titer, and depressed replication in C6/36, PS, and Vero cell lines.

A 631-bp PCR product was amplified using primers RRF1 and RRH1 from P. marneffei and seven other fungi, Penicillium spp., Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, Histoplasma capsulatum, Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans and C. krusei. A 15 oligonucleotide segment (Pm3) which was specific for P. marneffei was synthesized and used as a probe. Only the PCR products of P. marneffei isolates hybridized with the Pm3 oligonucleotide probe. The sensitivity of the assay was approximately 0.5 pg/microl and 0.1 pg/microl of DNA by PCR and Southern hybridization, respectively.

In this study, an OLA was designed to detect the Methionine to Valine mutation at codon 184 (M184V) of the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene in the circulating recombinant form AE strain of HIV-1 (HIV-1 CRF01_AE) common in Thailand, and was evaluated in Thai patients experiencing treatment failure. The subtype-specific OLA-CRF01_AE proved superior to OLA-ARRRP in detecting M184V, although this mutation existed in the genome of the multiple-drug-resistant virus at lower minimal detection levels of 3% prevalence of mutated virus, compared to 50% for OLA-ARRRP. On evaluation using clinical specimens, OLA-CRF01_AE showed excellent agreement with nucleotide sequencing (95.1% overall concordance, kappa>0.79), and the sensitivity was 100% for wild-type and 93.9% for mutant detection at codon 184.

Patients infected with GT3 viruses consistently respond better to IFN treatment than do patients infected with GT1 viruses. The mechanisms underlying this difference are not well understood. In this study, we sought to determine the effects of HCV NS5A proteins from different genotypes on IFN signaling. We found that the overexpression of either GT1 or GT3 NS5A proteins significantly inhibited IFN-induced IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) signaling, phosphorylated STAT1 (P-STAT1) levels, and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression compared to controls. GT1 NS5A protein expression exhibited stronger inhibitory effects on IFN signaling than did GT3 NS5A protein expression. Furthermore, GT1 NS5A bound to STAT1 with a higher affinity than did GT3 NS5A. Domain mapping revealed that the C-terminal region of NS5A conferred these inhibitory effects on IFN signaling. The overexpression of HCV NS5A increased HCV replication levels in JFH1-infected cells through the further reduction of levels of P-STAT1, ISRE signaling, and downstream ISG responses. We demonstrated that the overexpression of GT1 NS5A proteins resulted in less IFN responsiveness than did the expression of GT3 NS5A proteins through stronger binding to STAT1. We confirmed that GT1 NS5A proteins exerted stronger IFN signaling inhibition than did GT3 NS5A proteins in an infectious recombinant JFH1 virus. The potent antiviral NS5A inhibitor BMS-790052 did not block NS5A-mediated IFN signaling suppression in an overexpression model, suggesting that NS5A''s contributions to replication are independent of its subversive action on IFN.

A total of 642 (28.9%) specimens were found to be rotavirus positive. A changed prevalence pattern of rotavirus G serotype was found with an increase of G9 and G2 and a decrease of G1, although G1 remained the prevailing serotype. Serotype G9 was unexpectedly determined to be the prevailing serotype in Sapporo (62.5%) and Tokyo (52.9%) in 1998-1999, and in Saga (78.4%) in 1999-2000.

Both sequence and immunological analysis of VP7 revealed that the G9 strains from 1999-2000 were much more closely related to the G9 strains isolated worldwide in the 1990s, including G9 strains found in Thailand in 1997.

Yet, how this TLR3-dependent pathway operates in hepatocytes is unclear. Upon fractionating cultured hepatocytes into various cellular organelles, we observed that TLR3 predominantly resides in endolysosomes of hepatocytes. To determine the critical regulators of TLR3 signaling in response to HCV infection in human hepatocytes, we isolated endolysosome fractions from mock-infected and HCV-infected hepatoma Huh7.5 cells that had been reconstituted for TLR3 expression, separated these fractions on two-dimensional gels, and identified up-regulated/down-regulated proteins by mass spectrometry. Approximately a dozen of cellular proteins were found to be differentially expressed in endolysosome fractions following HCV infection. Of these, expression of several molecular chaperone proteins was elevated. Knockdown of one of these chaperones, glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78), compromised TLR3-dependent induction of interferon-stimulated genes and chemokines following HCV infection or poly(I:C) stimulation in cultured hepatocytes. Consistent with this finding, GRP78 depletion impaired TLR3-mediated establishment of an antiviral state. Mechanistically, although TLR3 trafficking to endolysosomes was not affected, phosphorylated IRF3 diminished faster following GRP78 knockdown.

In the anaerobic environment of the gut, ethanolamine supports little or no growth by fermentation. However, S. Typhimurium is able to use this carbon source by inducing the gut to produce a respiratory electron acceptor (tetrathionate), which supports anaerobic growth on ethanolamine. The gut normally converts ambient hydrogen sulfide to thiosulfate, which it then oxidizes further to tetrathionate during inflammation. Evidence is provided that S.

These syndromes differ with regard to the host niches in which Salmonella serovars grow and survive to ensure their transmission. During gastroenteritis, non-typhoidal Salmonella serovars such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) use their virulence factors to elicit acute intestinal inflammation, thereby creating a novel luminal niche. Reactive oxygen species produced by phagocytes in the intestinal lumen oxidize endogenous sulfur compounds to produce a new respiratory electron acceptor, tetrathionate. Respiration of tetrathionate confers a growth advantage to S. Typhimurium over competing microbes. This growth advantage ensures transmission of the pathogen by the faecal-oral route. In typhoid fever, S. enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) establishes a chronic infection in the gall bladder, and perhaps in additional niches. Studies using the mouse model of typhoid fever suggest that survival and proliferation in the gall bladder may involve several strategies. Invasion of the gallbladder epithelium and formation of biofilms on gallstones may protect the pathogen from the bactericidal activities of bile salts. In the gallbladder lumen, activation of bile defence responses may permit survival of planktonic Salmonella cells. Individuals developing chronic carriage after an episode of typhoid fever can transmit the disease for the remainder of their lives by shedding the pathogen through the cystic duct.

We found that 21 of the 25 VDJ genes used the a2-encoding genes, VH4 or VH7; the other four VDJ genes used four unknown VH gene segments. Because VH4 and VH7 are rarely found in VDJ genes of normal or young Alicia rabbits, we investigated the timing of rearrangement of these genes in Alicia rabbits.

Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that fibronectin bound to the surface of conidia and to phialides, but not to hyphae, in a pattern similar to that reported for laminin. Conidia were able to bind to fibronectin immobilized on microtiter plates in a concentration-dependent manner. However, binding to fibronectin (at any given concentration of protein and conidia) was less than that to laminin under equivalent conditions. Soluble fibronectin and antifibronectin antibody inhibited adherence of conidia to fibronectin in the plate adherence assay; soluble laminin also caused pronounced inhibition. Various monosaccharides and several peptides had no effect on adherence to fibronectin. However, N-acetylneuraminic acid abolished adherence to fibronectin, indicating that the interaction was mediated through a sialic acid-dependent process; the latter parallels observations of laminin binding by conidia. Fibronectin binding (and binding of laminin) was considerably reduced by prolonged preincubation of conidia with chymotrypsin, suggesting the protein nature of the binding site. Conidia from older cultures were more adherent to both immobilized fibronectin and laminin than conidia from younger cultures. Ligand affinity binding demonstrated the presence of a 20-kDa protein with the ability to bind both fibronectin and laminin.

Incubation of the wild type at 37°C, however, promotes the development of a yeast form that divides by fission. Development of the yeast morphology in vivo appears to be requisite for pathogenesis. In a prior study using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation for random mutagenesis via T-DNA integration, we generated a morphological mutant (strain I6) defective in conidiation. The T-DNA insertion site in strain I6 was determined to be within the gene encoding S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (sadA), an enzyme critical to spermidine biosynthesis. In the present study, we demonstrated that strain I6 was able to grow on rich media in either the mold or yeast forms at 25°C and 37°C, respectively. However, reduced growth of strain I6 was observed on minimal medium at either temperature. In addition, strain I6 produced mycelia with impaired conidiation on minimal medium at 25°C. Supplementation of minimal medium with spermidine restored the ability of strain I6 to produce conidia at 25°C and promoted yeast development at 37°C. Moreover, conidia of strain I6 exhibited poor germination frequencies in the absence of this polyamine.

PIA was shown to be a linear beta-1,6-linked glucosaminoglycan composed of at least 130 2-deoxy-2-amino-D-glucopyranosyl residues of which 80-85% are N-acetylated, the rest being non-N-acetylated and positively charged. A transposon insertion in the icaABC gene cluster (ica, intercellular adhesion) led to the loss of several traits, such as the ability to form a biofilm on a polystyrene surface, cell aggregation, and PIA production. The mutant could be complemented by transformation with the icaABC-carrying plasmid pCN27. Transfer of pCN27 into the heterologous host Staphylococcus carnosus led to the formation of large cell aggregates, the formation of a biofilm on a glass surface, and PIA expression. The nucleotide sequence of icaABC suggests that the three genes are organized in an operon and that they are co-transcribed from the mapped icaA promoter. IcaA contains four potential transmembrane helices, indicative of a membrane location. The deduced IcaA sequence shows similarity to those of polysaccharide-polymerizing enzymes, the most pronounced being with a Rhizobium meliloti N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase involved in lipo-chitin biosynthesis (22.5% overall identity and 37.4% overall similarity). This similarity suggests that IcaA has N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity in the formation of the beta-1, 6-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl polymer. IcaB is secreted into the medium and contains a typical signal peptide. IcaC is hydrophobic and contains six predicted transmembrane helices distributed over its entire length, typical for an integral membrane protein.

To clarify the functional roles of TLRs 2 and 4 in mast cells, we examined bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) from TLR2 or TLR4 gene-targeted mice. Peptidoglycan (PGN) from Staphylococcus aureus stimulated mast cells in a TLR2-dependent manner to produce TNF-alpha, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-13, but not IL-1beta. In contrast, LPS from Escherichia coli stimulated mast cells in a TLR4-dependent manner to produce TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-13, but not IL-4 nor IL-5. Furthermore, TLR2- but not TLR4-dependent mast cell stimulation resulted in mast cell degranulation and Ca2+ mobilization. In a mast cell-dependent model of acute sepsis, TLR4 deficiency of BMMCs in mice resulted in significantly higher mortality because of defective neutrophil recruitment and production of proinflammatory cytokines in the peritoneal cavity.

Renal failure patients who were indicated for dialysis and needed acute PD were classified as shock and nonshock groups, and then were randomized to receive either bicarbonate or lactate solution. Twenty patients were enrolled in this study (5 in each subgroup). In the shock group, there were more rapid improvements and significantly higher levels of blood pH (7.40 +/- 0.04 versus 7.28 +/- 0.05, p < 0.05), serum bicarbonate (23.30 +/- 1.46 versus 18.37 +/- 1.25 mmol/L, p < 0.05), systolic pressure (106.80 +/- 3.68 versus 97.44 +/- 3.94 mm Hg, p < 0.05), mean arterial pressure (80.72 +/- 2.01 versus 73.28 +/- 2.41 mm Hg, p < 0.05), percentages of phagocytosis of circulating leukocytes (65.85% +/- 2.22 versus 52.12% +/- 2.71, p < 0.05), and percentages of positive nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction test without and with stimulation (14.43 +/- 1.93 versus 9.43 +/- 2.12, p < 0.05 and 65.08 +/- 6.80 versus 50.23 +/- 4.21, p < 0.05, respectively) in the bicarbonate subgroup compared with the lactate subgroup.

Laz is very similar to azurin, a periplasmic protein, which belongs to the copper-containing proteins in the cupredoxin superfamily. In other bacteria, azurin is an electron donor to nitrite reductase, an important enzyme in the denitrifying process. It is not known whether Laz could function as an electron transfer protein in this important pathogen. Laz protein was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Electrospray mass spectrometry indicated that the Laz protein contains one copper ion. Laz was shown to be redox-active in the presence of its redox center copper ion. When oxidized, Laz exhibits an intense blue colour and absorbs visible light around 626 nm. The absorption is lost when exposed to diethyldithiocarbamate, a copper chelating agent. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against purified Laz for detecting expression of Laz under different growth conditions and to determine the orientation of Laz on the outer membrane. The expression of Laz under microaerobic and microaerobic denitrifying conditions was slightly higher than that under aerobic conditions. However, the expression of Laz was similar between the wild type strain and an fnr mutant, suggesting that Fumarate/Nitrate reduction regulator (FNR) does not regulate the expression of Laz despite the presence of a partial FNR box upstream of the laz gene.

Within the genus, there is considerable diversity and apparent redundancy in the components involved in respiration. Here, we identify a unique c-type cytochrome (cN ) that is broadly distributed among commensal Neisseria, but absent in the pathogenic species. Specifically, cN supports nitrite reduction in N. gonorrhoeae strains lacking the cytochromes c5 and CcoP established to be critical to NirK nitrite reductase activity. The c-type cytochrome domain of cN shares high sequence identity with those localized c-terminally in c5 and CcoP and all three domains were shown to donate electrons directly to NirK. Thus, we identify three distinct but paralogous proteins that donate electrons to NirK. We also demonstrate functionality for a N. weaverii NirK variant with a C-terminal c-type heme extension. Taken together, modular domain distribution and gene rearrangement events related to these respiratory electron carriers within Neisseria are concordant with major transitions in the macroevolutionary history of the genus.

An alternative arrangement appears to be widespread within the betaproteobacterial genus Neisseria, wherein several redox proteins are covalently associated with the outer membrane. In the present paper, we discuss the structural properties of these outer membrane redox proteins and the functional consequences of this attachment. Several tethered outer membrane redox proteins of Neisseria contain a weakly conserved repeated structure between the covalent tether and the redox protein globular domain that should enable the redox cofactor-containing domain to extend from the outer membrane, across the periplasm and towards the inner membrane. It is argued that the constraints imposed on the movement and orientation of the globular domains by these tethers favours the formation of electron-transfer complexes for entropic reasons. The attachment to the outer membrane may also affect the exposure of the host to redox proteins with a moonlighting function in the host-microbe interaction, thus affecting the host response to Neisseria infection. We identify putative outer membrane redox proteins from a number of other bacterial genera outside Neisseria, and suggest that this organizational arrangement may be more common than previously recognized.', '22103547', '2011', NULL, '1895-1899', '2016-10-19 22:23:25', '2016-10-19 22:23:25'),

Mutants were generated by allelic exchange with disrupted copies of the genes encoding these cytochromes and the phenotypes of the resultant mutants analysed. It was found that cytochrome c(5) is required for in vivo nitrite reductase activity, whereas cytochromes c(x) and c(4) are both required for efficient growth using oxygen as an electron acceptor. Mutants in c(x), c(4), and c(x)+c(4) have a decreased capacity to reduce oxygen, but there is a background oxygen-reduction activity, indicating that there may be other routes for electron transfer from the cytochrome bc(1) complex to the cytochrome cbb(3) oxidase, whereas cytochrome c(5) appears to be the sole route of electrons to the nitrite reductase in N. meningitidis. Interestingly, cytochrome c(x) is highly similar to a domain of copper nitrite reductases from various proteobacteria, whereas cytochrome c(5) has high identity with a domain of the cytochrome cbb(3) oxidase of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, yet these two proteins function in oxygen respiration and nitrite respiration, respectively.
